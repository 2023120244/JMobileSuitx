JMobileSuit is a Light-weight MobileSuit for Java. Migrated from .NET Core.

**Previously named as [PlasticMetal.JMobileSuitLite](https://github.com/Plastic-Metal/JMobileSuitLite).**

ReFreSH.MobileSuit is a Powerful tool to quickly build a ConsoleApp, written in C#, mapping command to a specific
method in your code.

For details of MobileSuit, see: https://github.com/HIT-ReFreSH/MobileSuit

As I'm new to Java, and limited by the JVM, some functions of MobileSuit are not supported in JMobileSuit, Including
but not limited to:

1. Method Members only
2. Instance Mode Only
3. No Async Support
