## What's JMobileSuit?

JMobileSuit provides an easy way to quickly build a Java Console App. It is migrated
from [MobileSuit (for .NET)](https://github.com/HIT-ReFreSH/MobileSuit).

Focus on writing the backend part, Import ReFreSH.MobileSuit, and simply write a Frontend in a very simple standard,
then a beautiful Console App is born.

> [!NOTE]
> Before starting, make sure you are already familiar with Java.
